# This project contains the demo for Aspire Demo Project and mobile-friendly for most of the standard screens.

# Following functionalities have been added as part of the development -

-- All the buttons are working, and have onclick event attached to them. And further development for new screens would be pretty
straight forward with the new components to be created and directly added.
-- Following buttons are interactive but no UI has been added for them, and thus interaction with them would tell user that these
feature will be part of next release : >All Company Cards >Set spend limit >Add to Gpay >Replace card >Home >Payments >Credit >Profile
-- As part of test, following three functionalities have been added to the demo project - >Add new card >Freeze/Unfreeze card >Cancel/Delete card
-- The account balance, card name, debit card no, expiry, and CVV is different for each card and thus changes when you swipe to next
card in "My Debit Cards" section.
-- The Freeze/Unfreeze option disables the card and its option of "Show Card number".
-- The Cancel card will ask for a prompt before deleting the card from the list.
-- The Add new card will give the user a option to add new card, with only card name being a editable field and other fields are
auto-generated.
-- The card-details dropdown is currently filled with limited but real card details.
-- The recent transactions are also real card transactions and have option to either see 3 top transactions or all transaction.
The "View all card transaction" button is working and will expand all the remaining transaction.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
